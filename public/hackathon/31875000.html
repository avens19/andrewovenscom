Yowser! You're killin' it.

For your next task, you are to find the longest palindrome substring of the string in the input file. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is spelled the same backwards or forwards. Eg: "Race car". 

<br/><br/>
<a href="./input.txt">input.txt</a>
<br/><br/>

The palindrome is the name of the next file.

Good luck!
