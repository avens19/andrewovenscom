Hey people, thanks for showing up today. 
<br/>
Let's get started. This will be a bit of a scavenger hunt today. Each step you will work out the file name of the next clue. If you cheat and look up an answer or jump ahead, you're out. I'll be looking at the code for each of your solutions. Now on with the fun!
<br/>
Your first task is to calculate the 44th fibonacci number recursively.

<br/>

The next task file name is the fibonacci number.

<br/>

Good luck!
