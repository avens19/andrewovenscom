You should probably stop, smartypants!
<br/>
For your next task, solve this fairly simple problem.

<br/><br/>
If you start with $1 and, with each move, you can either double your money or add another $1, what is the smallest number of moves you have to make to get to exactly $200? You must also show which steps are taken to find your solution.
<br/><br/>

The number is the name of the next file.

Good luck!
