"Weekly Budget" is a free app distributed by Andrew Ovens (avens19@gmail.com)

Weekly Budget is an app that helps you track your spending money and hopefully not spend more than your have.
The app does this by having you input your expenses (name, amount, category) and shows you how much you've spend
against your budget for the week.The app also has built-in sync that allows you to track your budget on multiple
devices or share a budget between spouses (for example). By having a sync, this necessitates keeping the data
on a centralized server. You make a change on one device, the change is synced to the server and the other device
can now sync that change from the server. While spending data is obviously potentially sensitive, the app collects
no Personally Identifiable Information to associate the spending data with you, the human. The spending data is
connected to a random string (known in the app as a Budget ID or Unique Budget ID). The string is what you pass
around to share your budget with others.

Beyond this security-through-obscurity approach, I have taken all standard precautions to protect your data. All
data is point-to-point encrypted between your device and the server. The database is protected behind a firewall.

I do not sell nor share any of the data from this app, nor will I ever do so. I made this app because my wife and I
wanted an easy way to stay on top of our spending money and I keep it running because people seem to like it. I
you want your data deleted from the database, feel free to send me an email.
